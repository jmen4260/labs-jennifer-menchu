   <p> In the body tag information that the creator of the document is trying to put out there. A paragraph tag displays the writing of the document. A head tag is used to add information that creates the web page, that other's can't see. </p>
   <p> I was switched from a different program to Web Development, so coming into this class I wasnt sure on what to expect, nor did I have any expectations for it. I hope to learn something useful and eventually come to actually want to do this. I don't want to spend months being in a class I'm not intrested in. I hope to become able to understand, and to do my assignments eventually without needing to have guidance. Personally I'm not sure how this class will help me, but I'm sure I'll be surprised. </p>
