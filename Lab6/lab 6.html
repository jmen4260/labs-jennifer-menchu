     <p>Favicons are used in browser tabs, browser history, toolbar apps, bookmarks dropdown, search bar, and search bar recommendations. They help people identify a website, making it easier for someone to search up or click on.To make a favicon, first you have to make sure your image is saved as a PNG. The file should be at least 16Ã—16 in size. Then, convert the image into the ICO format. Upload to your website and add basic html code. My favicon uses binary codes and things as such to create a palm tree with flowers around it.</p>
